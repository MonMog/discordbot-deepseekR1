# Preface
My current vision for this project is to run deepseekr1 using the 1.5b locally and to somehow have my discord bot capture the input from the user given in chat, run it in ollama, and then capture the output and display it back to the user in the chat. Seems simple enough when typed out and in one sentence, get ollama to run deepseek, have the discord bot provide the input and display the output. I have no idea what I am doing but this will be a learning experience.

# Process
## Setting up ollama
We are going to head over to ollama.com and download based off our OS (I am using the windows download). After it's done downloading, it will install and when it's finished it will open up a command prompt for us. I went ahead and closed it and made a separate directory for it and opened CMD there and typed "ollama -h" and it worked. We now need the model itself, where deepseek comes in. I am going to be using the deepseekR1 1.5B model because I am limited by the technology of my time.
